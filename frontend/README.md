## 🎯 What's This All About?

This frontend is like having a conversation with your AI buddy, but with style! Built with **Next.js 14** and the **App Router**, it features:
- **Real-time streaming responses** - Watch the AI think in real-time! 🤯
- **Beautiful, modern UI** - Because ugly interfaces are so 2010 😎
- **Server-side rendering** - Lightning-fast initial page loads

- **Smart settings panel** - Configure your AI experience without breaking a sweat
- **Auto-scrolling chat** - No more manual scrolling like a caveman! 📱💻🖥️

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you dive in, make sure you have:
- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** - Comes with Node.js
- **Your FastAPI backend running** - Check out the `api/README.md` for backend setup
- **OpenAI API key** - Get one from [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/)

## 🔑 API Key Setup

The API key is managed securely on the backend only. Here's how to set it up:

### Backend Environment Variable

1. **Set the environment variable** in your backend:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Or create a `.env` file** in the `api` directory:
   ```bash
   cd api
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_actual_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

3. **Restart your backend server** after setting the environment variable

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Secure** - API key never leaves the backend
- ✅ **Simple** - No frontend configuration needed
- ✅ **Production ready** - Perfect for deployment
- ✅ **No browser storage** - No security concerns

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
First, let's get all the cool packages installed:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Your API Key
Configure your OpenAI API key as an environment variable on the backend (see instructions above).

### 3. Start the Development Server
Fire up the development server and watch the magic happen:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`. If it doesn't, just manually navigate there!

### 4. Configure Your Settings (Optional)
Once the app loads, you can customize your experience:
- **Model selection** - Choose between GPT-4o Mini, GPT-4o, or GPT-3.5 Turbo
- **System message** - Customize how the AI behaves

### 5. Start Chatting!
Now you're ready to have some amazing conversations! Just type your message and hit Enter (or click the send button). Watch as the AI responds in real-time - it's like magic! ✨

## 🎨 Features That'll Blow Your Mind

### Real-time Streaming
Unlike those old-school chat apps that make you wait for the entire response, this one streams the AI's thoughts in real-time. It's like watching someone type, but way faster!

### Next.js 14 App Router
- **Server Components** - Better performance and SEO
- **Client Components** - Interactive UI where needed
- **Built-in API Routes** - Seamless backend integration
- **Automatic Code Splitting** - Faster page loads

### Smart UI/UX
- **Auto-resizing input** - The text area grows as you type (up to a reasonable limit)
- **Message timestamps** - Know exactly when each message was sent
- **Loading indicators** - Beautiful spinning animations while the AI thinks
- **Error handling** - Clear, friendly error messages when something goes wrong

### Responsive Design
Whether you're on a massive desktop monitor or a tiny phone screen, this interface adapts perfectly. It's like having a personal tailor for your UI!

### Security First
- **Backend-only API key** - Never exposed to the frontend
- **Environment variables** - Secure configuration management
- **No browser exposure** - No risk of client-side leaks
- **Clear error handling** - Proper error messages for missing keys

## 🎯 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server (the one you'll use most)
- `npm run build` - Creates a production build (for when you're ready to deploy)
- `npm start` - Starts the production server
- `npm run lint` - Runs ESLint to check code quality

## 🔧 Configuration

The app automatically connects to your FastAPI backend running on `http://localhost:8000` thanks to the Next.js rewrites configuration in `next.config.js`. If your backend is running on a different port, just update the rewrite rule!

## 🔐 Security Features

### API Key Management
- **Backend-only storage** - API key never leaves the server
- **Environment variables** - Secure configuration
- **No browser exposure** - No risk of client-side leaks
- **Clear error handling** - Proper error messages for missing keys

### Best Practices
1. **Never commit API keys** - Keep them in environment variables
2. **Use different keys** - Separate keys for development and production
3. **Monitor usage** - Keep track of your API usage
4. **Secure deployment** - Use proper environment variable management in production

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Backend server is not running"
Make sure your FastAPI backend is running! Check the `api/README.md` for instructions.

### "OpenAI API key not found"
You need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable on your backend:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_key_here
```

### "Failed to send message"
Check your API key and make sure you have credits in your OpenAI account.

### "Rate limit exceeded"
You've hit your OpenAI API quota. Check your billing and plan details.

### The app looks weird on my screen
Try refreshing the page or check if your browser is up to date. This app uses modern CSS features!

### Build errors
Make sure you're using Node.js 18+ and that all dependencies are properly installed.

## 🚀 Deployment

When you're ready to show this to the world:

1. **Set up environment variables** in your hosting platform:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
   ```

2. **Build the production version**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy to your favorite hosting service**:
   - **Vercel** (recommended for Next.js) - Just connect your GitHub repo
   - **Netlify** - Upload the `.next` folder
   - **AWS, Google Cloud, etc.** - Use the production build

## 🆚 Next.js vs Create React App

Why did we choose Next.js? Here's why it's awesome:

| Feature | Next.js | Create React App |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Performance** | Server-side rendering, automatic optimization | Client-side only |
| **SEO** | Built-in SEO support | Requires additional setup |
| **Routing** | File-based routing | Requires React Router |
| **API Routes** | Built-in API routes | Requires separate backend |
| **Image Optimization** | Automatic image optimization | Manual optimization |
| **Bundle Size** | Automatic code splitting | Manual optimization needed |
